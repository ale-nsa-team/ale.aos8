module: aos8_command
author: Samuel Yip
short_description: Module to run commands on remote devices.
description:
  - Sends arbitrary commands to an aos8 node and returns the results read from the device.
    This module includes an argument that will cause the module to wait for a specific
    condition before returning or timing out if the condition is not met.
  - This module does not automatically save the configuration into memory and flash. 
version_added: 1.0.0
notes:
  - Tested against Alcatel-Lucent AOS 8 8.9.221.R03 GA.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
    See U(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_aos8.html)
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - List of commands to send to the remote aos8 device over the configured provider.
        The resulting output from the command is returned. If the I(wait_for) argument
        is provided, the module is not returned until the condition is satisfied or
        the number of retries has expired. If a command sent to the device requires
        answering a prompt, it is possible to pass a dict containing I(command), I(answer)
        and I(prompt). Common answers are 'y' or "\\r" (carriage return, must be double
        quotes). See examples.
    required: true
    type: list
    elements: raw
  wait_for:
    description:
      - List of conditions to evaluate against the output of the command. The task will
        wait for each condition to be true before moving forward. If the conditional
        is not true within the configured number of retries, the task fails. See examples.
    aliases:
      - waitfor
    type: list
    elements: str
  match:
    description:
      - The I(match) argument is used in conjunction with the I(wait_for) argument to
        specify the match policy.  Valid values are C(all) or C(any).  If the value
        is set to C(all) then all conditionals in the wait_for must be satisfied.  If
        the value is set to C(any) then only one of the values must be satisfied.
    default: all
    type: str
    choices:
      - any
      - all
  retries:
    description:
      - Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered
        failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against
        the I(wait_for) conditions.
    default: 9
    type: int
  interval:
    description:
      - Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If
        the command does not pass the specified conditions, the interval indicates how
        long to wait before trying the command again.
    default: 1
    type: int

- name: Run multiple commands and evaluate the output
  ale.aos8.aos8_command:
    commands:
      - show system
      - show interfaces
    wait_for:
      - result[0] contains aos8
      - result[1] contains Loopback0
